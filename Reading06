*Creating an object: Literal Notation

    var hotel ={

        name: 'Quay',
        rooms: 40,
        booked: 25,
        gym: true,
        roomTypes: ['twin','double','suite'],
        checkAvailability: function(){
            return this.rooms - this.booked;        <=to access any variable inside the { }, need this.
        }
    }

	


    -property (variable)
    -method (function)
    -property and method format - key1 : value1, key2: value2 
    -method : 'this' is used to indicate that 'this object'; to access any variable inside the {}, need this.
    -Creating an empty object: var hotel = {};
    -Accessing an object and Dot Notation:

        var hotelName = hotel.name;
        var roomsFree = hotel.checkAvailability();

    -Object Literal: put many objects in an array!
    -There is another way to Creating many objects by Constructor Notation (see Reading07).
